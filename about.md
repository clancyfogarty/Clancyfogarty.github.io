Hello, I'm Clancy Fogarty and am currently located in South Lake Tahoe, CA. I am a aspiring Web Developer, student and IT Professional. I received my undergraduate degree in Accounting and Information Systems from the University of Nevada, Reno (GO WOLF PACK!). I am currently pursing a Masters of Science in Cyber Security from the University of San Diego. I am also enrolled in BLOC Web Developer program. I enjoy coding and when I am not doing it I am outdoors, snowboarding and playing with my puppy Riddles.
