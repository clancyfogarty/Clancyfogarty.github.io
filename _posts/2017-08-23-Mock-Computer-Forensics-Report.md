***Background to the case***

On November 29th 2016, Brandy Vela of Texas City, TX fatally shot herself in front of family in her home. Brandy has reported serious cyber bullying to the school and even reportedly to the authorities in the months leading up to the suicide. The relatives of Brandy Vela confirmed there has been a long standing smear and cyber bullying campaign against Brandy Vela.

The bullies were said to have created phony Facebook accounts and harassed her quite frequently. The accounts were created after the previous account had been reported and shut down by Facebook. In the hours leading up to the suicide Brandy had texted her family member she loved them and when they went upstairs to check on they witnessed the suicide. Brandy herself did not know who the culprit was or culprits behind the cyberbullying campaign and even changed her cell phone number numerous times in an effort to thwart the bullies’ continuous and cruel attacks.

***Charges against the accused***

On March 16, 2017 Andres Arturo Villagomez (21-years-old) and Karinthya Sanchez Romero (22-years-old) were arrested and charged for their alleged actions that led the 18-year-old Brandy Vela to commit suicide (CBS News, 2017).  The charges against them are listed in the table below:

* Andres Arturo Villagomez -- Stalking; Online Impersonation

* Karinthya Sanchez Romero -- Unlawful disclosure or promotion of intimate visual material

(CBS News, 2017).

Investigators have stating Romero made numerous threatening and harassing calls and text messages to Vela over the course of several months. Villagomez was found to have set up fake Facebook accounts in the victim’s name to post harassing, intimidating and harassing content about Vela herself. Court documents also allege Villagomez provided photographs, which he obtained from the victim herself when they engaged in romantic relationship, to the internet that showed Vela in sexually graphic poses (CBS News, 2017).

***Preparation***

The text messages, Facebook account, Facebook messenger, email, and other social media accounts need to be extracted and analyzed for evidence of cyber bullying or other incriminating evidence. The mobile device of Brandy Vela has been acquired for evidence gathering during this investigation. The passwords to previously listed accounts needed to be obtained to access information within.

The family of Brandy Vela were able to provide the password to the mobile device: 4010. Hirens a powerful and useful computer tool was used to crack the passwords needed for the other accounts. Instructions for the usage of Hirens can be found on their website (Hiren & Pankaj's Homepage, 2017).  After that hurdle was jumped the device was fully ready to be analyzed with the help of the FTK Imager.
The mobile device to be analyzed is the IPhone 7 16 GB. The serial number of the device is: JKL569GH22000LMV.

***Legal Issues***

As with any investigation legal issues or hurdles can arise. Listed are several faced during the course of this investigation:

* Jurisdiction issues were thought to be a possible issue to arise due to the information needing to be accesses saved on remote servers. However, this did not turn out to be an issue during the investigation due to the mobile device user (Brandy Vela) had downloaded all content locally to the mobile device so no remote server was needed to access the data.

* A search warrant needs to be obtained in order to be legally allowed to access said devices without unlawful seizure. At this time the password of the device should be provided to law enforcement through a subpoena. If password is unknown some analysis cannot be made due to encryption issues. The passwords to social media accounts was able to be accessed through a password cracking tool. The passcode to the device was provided by the family.

All necessary warrants and documents were sought out, approved and granted during this investigation and can be provided upon request.

***Chain of Custody***

The chain of custody, notes and other documents need to be kept at all times during the investigation. The chain of custody was established upon taking custody of the mobile device and packaging the device. The logs are assured to be accurate and do not have a lapse in the custody or the device or the timeline listed in it.

Upon inspecting these logs it can be assumed the chain of custody was not broken during this investigation. An example of the form used to keep track of the chain of custody for the mobile device during this investigation is provided below in the appendix.

The evidence submitted for Analysis that was obtained from the warrant is:
* Device :	IPhone 7 16GB 		

* Serial Number:  JKL569GH22000LMV

The evidence logs as well as the chain of custody logs can be submitted to the court upon request.

***Analysis***

A copy or backup of the device (mobile device) using FTK imager was made to ensure the preservation of the original data file. This copy is kept for safe keeping. Another copy of the device information is then made to be analyzed for deleted files, geographic data, IP address and other networking information and more. The original backup was not utilized at all during this investigation.

Upon analysis of the mobile device the following facts were found/confirmed:
* The victim had been harassed through the medium of social media, phone calls and text messages since March 2016.

* Messages were sent to the victim (Vela) regarding her weight in a derogatory way as well as other derogatory comments and images.

* The messages sent to the victim were sent using a prepaid Go phone. This device was the source of all messages sent to the victim since the beginning in March 2016. This device was unable to be traced back to a name and no identifying information was to be found on the device.

* The messages sent to the victim via Facebook had the same IP address across the different accounts. The IP address was tracked down to Andres Arturo Villagomez’s residence.

* The messages and multiple accounts that were used to harass the victim had been deleted from the mobile device. However, trace amounts of data pertaining to these messages and social media accounts that were left behind on the device were still able to extracted and analyzed.

***Conclusion***

During the steps of recovering and analyzing the data for this case, no harm came to the original data. The integrity remained during the entire investigation by checking hash values and creating various copies. The evidence chain of custody remained intact during the entire course of the investigation due to evidence logs. Paperwork was kept and updated since the initial seizure and bagging of the device. Overall it can be reasonably assumed through computer forensics analysis of the mobile device in question the victim did in fact suffer from multiple cyber bullying attacks over the course of 5 months. The wrong doings of the accused (i.e. Andres Arturo Villagomez and Karinthya Sanchez Romero) have been confirmed based on the findings during the course of the investigation.
