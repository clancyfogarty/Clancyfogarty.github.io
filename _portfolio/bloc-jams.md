## Summary

This project was built in two phases:
<ol>
  <li>Phase 1: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and DOM scripting <
  <li>Phase 2: refractor and Rebuild Bloc-Jams using AngularJS framework.
</ol>

Bloc-Jams was the first assignment assigned to me during my time at Bloc. The first phase of the project was my first hands on experience with web development. The project(s) served as a means to strengthen HTML5, CSS & JS skills, while introducing me to new tools including jQuery, DOM Scripting, AngularJS & many of its associated tools.

<h1><u>Phase 1:</u></h1>

##Problem

The goal of this project was to build a web application to play selected music files. The most challenging aspect to this project was designing the application to handle an unknown quantity of albums and songs.

##Solution

In order to solve the challenge while creating a user friendly experience and still retain full functionality the following methods were used. Templates were created for each item and JS, DOM scripts, and jQuery selectors loop through and display the files/information. HTML and CSS were utilized to list the content, while the other listed tools were able to sort/select/display and even play the files.

##Results

By integrating HTML5, CSS, JS, jQuery and more, I was able to create a fully functional landing page, an album collections page, and a music player page.
<h3>Landing Page </h3>
The landing page displays a large photo background with selling points listed across the bottom of the page. A slogan is listed in the center. A link to the collections page is listed in the top right.
<h3>Collections Page</h3>
The album collections page will list as many albums as the collection holds. If you click on an album it will take you to the music player page for that album.
<h3>Music Player</h3>
The music player page allows the user to play music. By clicking on the song or the play button itself, the user has full control of the player and album library.

<h2><u>Phase 2:</u></h2>

##Summary

The second phase of the project is still underway. Check back at a later time to see updates.

##Project Conclusion

Thus far this project has been a great learning tool. Phase one gave me experience writing DOM scripts, using jQuery and HTML & CSS practice and JS scripts as well. Phase 2 of the project will be updated once complete.
